# API Key Security Best Practices

## What Happened

GitHub's secret scanning detected an OpenAI API key in your repository. This is a security risk as exposed API keys can be misused by malicious actors, potentially leading to unauthorized usage and unexpected charges.

## Changes Made

The following files were updated to remove any potential API key exposure:

1. `.env` - Updated to ensure it only contains placeholder values
2. `openai_sql_query.py` - Enhanced comments to emphasize not hardcoding API keys
3. `test_sql_agent_fix.py` - Modified to mask API keys completely without showing any part of the actual key

## Best Practices for API Key Management

### 1. Never Commit API Keys to Git

- Always use environment variables or secure secret management systems
- Add `.env` files to `.gitignore` (this is already done in your project)
- Use placeholder values in example files (like `.env.example`)

### 2. Use Environment Variables

Your project already uses environment variables correctly with:
```python
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

### 3. For Deployment

- For local development: Use `.env` files (but never commit them)
- For production: Use environment variables set in your hosting platform
- For CI/CD: Use secrets management in your CI/CD platform (GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables, etc.)

### 4. If You Accidentally Commit an API Key

1. **Revoke the key immediately** - Generate a new API key and invalidate the old one
2. **Remove the key from Git history** - This is complex and may require force-pushing
   - Consider using tools like BFG Repo-Cleaner or git-filter-repo
   - Or follow GitHub's instructions at the URL provided in the error message

### 5. Additional Security Measures

- Implement API key rotation policies
- Use the principle of least privilege (only grant necessary permissions)
- Consider using API key management services

## For This Project

1. Create a `.env.example` file with placeholder values
2. Make sure all developers know to create their own `.env` file locally
3. Ensure CI/CD pipelines use secure environment variables

Remember: The best API key is one that never appears in your code or Git history!
